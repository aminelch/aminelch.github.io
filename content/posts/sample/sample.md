**Wait a minute!**
Didn't I say that moving to cloud isn't just a purchasing exercise? ü§î

![surprise.gif](surprise.gif)

Your move to cloud should not be solely based on cutting costs or making purchasing IT more efficient.
Most teams find that moving to cloud is more expensive than they anticipated because they're finally able to get access to the right amount of resources that they need.
_(Also, they usually go with some more expensive options up front until they figure out how to optimize for cost.)_

First off, it's much easier to budget and pay one vendor for multiple services than deal with multiple independent vendors.
Instead of paying for datacenter space, then paying for servers, then paying for network equipment, then paying for people to set it up, and so on, you pay the cloud provider for all of it.

This also extends to other purchases on the cloud, such as products from certain vendors.
For example, you can buy Red Hat products directly from some cloud providers and that gets added onto your cloud invoice.
You can even deploy your own [Cisco ASA in the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-sltshxd3bzqbg) if you feel so inclined.

With all of these purchases going through one vendor, you can also negotiate discounts if you set a spending commitment.
Discounts depend on your committed spend, of course, and the term that you agree to spend it.
There's a whole industry around financial operations in the cloud, called [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/), and this is one of many things that factors into it.

# Wrapping up

Public clouds offer an incredible amount of opportunity to get your IT deployments into better shape with better change control and a solid software-defined workflow.
They also offer the ability to "write one check" to consume infrastructure via utility billing.

**However, public clouds are not ideal for every application or situation.**

Do I think that **every company** in the world could benefit from getting some part of their IT deployments into a public cloud platform?
**Yes, I do.**

Would **every company** benefit from putting most of their infrastructure into public clouds?
**Very unlikely.**

Some applications still benefit from being on purpose-built hardware or in certain locations where a cloud might not exist today.
Clouds can also be extremely expensive if you run large workloads around the clock.
They can also be painful for applications with very strict or special requirements that don't fit a cloud deployment model well.

Those companies that help their customers **benefit from the best of what public clouds have to offer** in the most secure, reliable, and simple ways will be in the driver's seat.

  The only way to win is to avoid it entirely.
